The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend is developed using either Python or Node.js. For data storage, SQLite or MySQL databases are used, and optional tools like Markdown editors and cloud storage APIs can be integrated to enhance functionality.

Steps to Install & Run the Project

To install and run the project, users need to download or clone the project folder, install the required dependencies using pip or npm, and set up the database by running the setup script. After that, the server can be started using python app.py or npm start, and the application can be accessed through a web browser via the local host link.

Instructions for Testing

Testing involves creating sample notes to ensure they are saved correctly, using the search bar to check keyword-based results, adding tags to verify filtering, and editing or deleting notes to confirm smooth functionality. It is also important to check how well the system responds on different screen sizes.
